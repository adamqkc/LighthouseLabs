### Preamble ðŸ’»

Last week you learned about _JavaScript_. You used the language to write programs that satisfy specific requirements and ran them using node. This week you will learn how to take the js you have been learning and start to Interface or communicate with the web. Specifically you will do this with  HTTP requests. 

But first let's get an overview on how the internet works.

## Internet 101


We know that in order to load a webpage, we type a URL (aka Link) into the address bar of our browser. Once we hit enter, the browser loads for a few seconds and BAAM the page is on your screen.

Behind the scenes a lot is happening when we load a web page, so let's try and break it down.

ï¿¼

In order for your computer's browser (akaÂ client, where frontend code lives) to be able to load webpages, it starts communicating with a server. (Another computer or networked device connected to the internet). Your computer sends a request for the resources that it needs from the server in the form of a URL.(akaÂ URLs) 

Url examoles:

The communication is achieved with a communication channel calledÂ HTTPÂ (Hyper-Text-Transfer-Protocol)

## HTTP
Http is the backbone of the web and the primary way of how we communicate over it. if the internet is the information highway http makes up some of the rules of the road.

Http stands for hypertext transfer protocol.which is the technical lingo for what it actually does,Â helps devices communicate over a networkÂ by a series of requests and responses (i.e. over internet or local network).
